Recipes project for HTML practice

This project aims to create a web page with a list of meals that have functioning links to their respective recipes. Once I've completed this project, I hope to cement my skills in HTML such as:

- Setting up the boilerplate
- Using headings and paragraphs where appropriate
- Correct use of images and image alts
- Creating functioning links
- Pushing the project to GitHub and making appropriate commits
